    "I can't say what the time would be for when we use a tolerance of $10^{-7}$ since just using $10^{-2}$ uses 50 terms compared to $10^{-1}$ using 5. I tried it but my computer went extremely slow and the list was way too long. Hence for part a, the values tried only were -1 and -2 since -7 would make the notebook extremely laggy when opening\n",
    "I tried it with $10^{-1}$ & $10^{-2}$ and had a wall time of 0ms and 2ms respectively. Based on this, would think 16 decimal places would take about 0.06ms and 32 decimal places would be 0.12 ms. I used simple fractions to estimate these. But it's worth noting that there is a big uncertainty in the times i got, hence the times I estimated. \n",
    "Overall, I think this is a great algorithm to calculate pi since its fairly simple, given that you have a powerful enough computer to withstand extremely low tolerance values."
